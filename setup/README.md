## Sample experiences in the `setup` folder

The `setup` folder contains small, optional examples that showcase how AI‑powered text and image features can look and feel in a lightweight playground.

These examples are not required for normal use of LlumDocs. They are typically used by:

- people who want to experiment with basic chat‑style interactions,
- or teams exploring how underlying language and vision models behave before integrating them more deeply.

From an end‑user perspective:

- The main LlumDocs application (described in the root `README.md` and `docs/GUI_SCREENSHOTS.md`) is where you will usually work.
- The examples in `setup` are separate, simplified experiences that may or may not be enabled in your environment.

If your organisation exposes any of these examples, your internal contact will provide:

- the way to access them (for example, a temporary URL or a command),
- and guidance on how they relate to the main LlumDocs product.
