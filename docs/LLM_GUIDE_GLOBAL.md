## How LlumDocs helps you work with documents, emails, and images

This guide explains LlumDocs from an end‑user point of view: what it is good at, what you can expect from it, and how to use it effectively in your daily work.

LlumDocs acts as a smart assistant that:

- understands text in Catalan, Spanish, and English,
- reads and summarises long or complex documents,
- extracts key information from structured files,
- describes images,
- and helps you triage and understand emails.

### What LlumDocs is designed to do

LlumDocs focuses on a few core goals:

- **Save time on reading**
  Turn long documents, reports, and email threads into short, accurate summaries that keep the important details.

- **Bridge language barriers**
  Translate and rewrite content between Catalan, Spanish, and English while preserving tone and intent.

- **Improve clarity and tone**
  Simplify complex text for non‑experts, or make drafts more formal and professional for external communication.

- **Make hidden information visible**
  Extract key fields from delivery notes, bank statements, and payroll documents, and describe the content of images.

- **Support safer and smarter email handling**
  Suggest how emails should be routed, highlight phishing risk, and surface overall sentiment.

You can combine these abilities in different ways depending on your role and tasks.

- Scan the main topics of large documents via keywords.
- Understand the overall tone and urgency of incoming communication.

### What to expect from LlumDocs’ answers

LlumDocs is designed to:

- **Respect your input**
  It focuses on reusing and transforming the content you provide rather than inventing new facts.

- **Adapt to your language**
  For most features, it matches the language of your input or the language you explicitly choose.

- **Stay concise where it matters**
  Summaries and keywords aim to be short and focused, so you can scan them quickly.

- **Preserve important details**
  When simplifying text, it keeps key facts and decisions intact, and when making text more technical, it adds clarity without changing the underlying meaning.

Because LlumDocs relies on AI, you should still:

- validate critical numbers, dates, and legal details,
- treat generated content as a draft you can review and edit,
- and follow your organisation’s policies for sensitive data.

### Tips for getting the best results

- **Be clear about your goal**
  Before you click a button, think: “What do I need from this text or document?” For example:
  - “I want a short summary I can paste into a ticket.”
  - “I need a professional email reply in Spanish.”
  - “I want to know if this email looks suspicious.”

- **Choose the right feature**
  Use:
  - **Summaries** for long content,
  - **Translation** for multilingual communication,
  - **Text transformation** to change tone or complexity,
  - **Document extraction** when you need structured fields,
  - **Image description** for visual content,
  - **Email intelligence** for routing, risk, and sentiment.

- **Provide enough context**
  When asking for rewrites or summaries, including a short note such as:
  - “For a non‑technical customer,”
  - “Internal report for management,”
  - or “Short reply confirming we received the document”
  helps LlumDocs choose a better style.

- **Review before sending**
  Use LlumDocs to draft and accelerate, then:
  - read the final result,
  - adjust names, dates, and specific references,
  - and make sure it matches your organisation’s policies.
