## Practical tips for using LlumDocs effectively

This guide collects short, practical suggestions for getting the most value out of LlumDocs in everyday work.
It is written for people who use LlumDocs, not for those who build or maintain it.

### 1. Choosing the right tool for your task

- **Need to read something faster?**
  Use **Document summaries** to get the main points before you dive into details.

- **Working across languages?**
  Use **Translation** to read or reply in Catalan, Spanish, or English while keeping tone and meaning.

- **Want clearer or more professional wording?**
  Use **Text transformation**:
  - “Plain language” for non‑experts,
  - “Technical tone” for specialists,
  - “Company tone” for polished emails.

- **Handling structured documents (like statements or payroll)?**
  Use **Document extraction** to pull out key fields instead of retyping.

- **Working with images?**
  Use **Image description** to capture what the image shows in text.

- **Unsure how to triage or respond to an email?**
  Use **Email intelligence** to see routing suggestions, phishing risk, and sentiment.

### 2. Writing good inputs

The quality of your input has a big impact on the output. A few simple habits help:

- **Be specific about the audience**
  Mention who the text is for (for example, “for a customer without technical background” or “internal summary for finance”).

- **Include all relevant context together**
  When summarising or rewriting, paste the full paragraph, email, or section instead of fragments from different places.

- **Clarify your goal in one sentence**
  For example:
  - “Short bullet‑point summary for a status update.”
  - “Polite follow‑up email asking for missing documents.”
  - “Plain‑language version I can share with a patient.”

- **Avoid including unrelated content**
  Remove signatures, disclaimers, and repeated threads unless they are important for your task.

### 3. Reviewing and editing results

LlumDocs is an assistant, not a final decision‑maker. Before you send or store results:

- **Scan for critical details**
  - Check names, dates, amounts, and reference numbers.
  - Make sure obligations, decisions, or deadlines are still correct.

- **Adjust wording to your style**
  - Personalise greetings and closings.
  - Adapt examples and references so they match your organisation and context.

- **Keep a record when necessary**
  - If you use LlumDocs for important communications, save the final text in your normal systems (ticket, CRM, document repository) as you would with any manually written content.

### 4. Working safely with sensitive information

Follow your organisation’s policies when using LlumDocs with personal, financial, or confidential data.

- Only paste or upload content that you are allowed to process with AI tools.
- When in doubt, anonymise or redact unnecessary details before using a feature.
- Avoid including passwords, private keys, or similar secrets.
- If your organisation provides internal guidance on AI usage, treat it as the source of truth.

If you are unsure, ask your security or compliance contact how LlumDocs should be used with your data.

### 5. Using LlumDocs in recurring workflows

LlumDocs is most powerful when you use it consistently for repeated tasks. For example:

- **Weekly reports**
  - Collect notes or exports from your systems.
  - Use summaries and text transformation to prepare a concise report for stakeholders.

- **Customer email queues**
  - Use email intelligence to triage and prioritise.
  - Use translation and company‑tone rewrites to send faster, higher‑quality replies.

- **Document onboarding**
  - For each new type of document (such as a new payroll layout), test extraction on a few examples.
  - Decide which fields matter to your team and how you will store them.

By standardising how you use LlumDocs in these flows, you make outcomes more predictable and save more time.

### 6. When something looks wrong

If a result seems off:

- Try the same request again with:
  - clearer instructions,
  - more complete input,
  - or a different feature (for example, summary first, then rewrite).
- Compare the result with the original document or email.
- If it still looks incorrect or confusing, raise it with the team that manages LlumDocs and share:
  - what you put in,
  - which feature you used,
  - and why the result did not meet your expectations.

Feedback like this helps your organisation decide how to improve prompts, workflows, or usage guidelines.
