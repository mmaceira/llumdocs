## Getting started with LlumDocs

This guide explains how you typically start using LlumDocs, whether you access it through your browser or through other tools in your organisation.

LlumDocs is usually prepared and maintained by an administrator or platform team. As an end user, you normally only need to know:

- where to access it,
- how to sign in (if required),
- and which part of the interface to use for your task.

### 1. Accessing LlumDocs in your organisation

LlumDocs can be offered in different ways, for example:

- **Through a web link**: you open a URL in your browser and interact with the interface directly.
- **Embedded in another tool**: some features (such as translation, summaries, or email intelligence) may appear as buttons or panels inside the tools you already use (ticketing systems, CRM, intranet, and so on).
- **Through automated workflows**: certain processes (like document ingestion or email routing) may call LlumDocs in the background, without you visiting a separate screen.

To start using LlumDocs:

1. Ask your internal contact (IT, data team, or project owner) for:
   - the URL or entry point you should use,
   - any login details or single sign‑on requirements,
   - and which features are enabled in your environment.
2. Open the link and sign in if prompted.
3. Explore the available tabs and options; they usually include translation, summaries, text transformation, image description, document extraction, and email intelligence.

### 2. Using LlumDocs through the web interface

When you open LlumDocs in your browser, you will see different tabs or sections, each dedicated to a specific capability:

- **Translation**: work with multilingual text.
- **Summaries**: condense long documents.
- **Text transformation**: simplify, make more technical, or adapt to company tone.
- **Image description**: generate captions and descriptions from images.
- **Document extraction**: turn structured documents into key fields you can reuse.
- **Email intelligence**: route and assess emails.

Within each tab:

1. Read the short description at the top to confirm you are in the right place.
2. Provide the required input (for example, paste text, upload a file, or choose a document type).
3. Click the main action button (such as “Translate”, “Summarise”, or “Analyse”).
4. Review the result and copy or download it as needed for your work.

You can move between tabs at any time; results remain visible in the page until you clear or change them.

### 3. Using LlumDocs through other tools

In many organisations, LlumDocs is connected to existing systems so you can benefit from its capabilities without leaving the tools you already know.

Examples include:

- A “Translate” button next to long comments or descriptions.
- A “Summarise” option for documents or tickets.
- An automatic “Email intelligence” check applied to new messages in a shared inbox.

In these cases:

1. Look for labels such as “Translate with LlumDocs”, “Summarise with LlumDocs”, or similar wording.
2. Follow any prompts the system shows you (for example, choose a target language or a summary style).
3. Use the generated content directly in your current workflow (send the email, update the ticket, attach the summary, and so on).

If you are unsure whether LlumDocs is active in a particular system, your internal administrator can confirm how it has been integrated.

### 4. Getting help and support

If you have questions about how LlumDocs is set up in your environment, or if something does not work as expected:

- Check any internal documentation or quick‑start guides your organisation provides.
- Contact the team that gave you access (for example, IT, data, or the product owner) and mention which feature you were using and what you were trying to do.

When you report an issue, it is helpful to share:

- the feature you used (for example, “Text translation”, “Document extraction”, or “Email intelligence”),
- the type of content you were working with (such as an email, PDF, image, or pasted text),
- and what result you expected (for example, “a Catalan version of this email” or “the main amounts from this bank statement”).

### 5. Where to learn more

- For an overview of the main capabilities and how they look, see `docs/GUI_SCREENSHOTS.md`.
- For a feature‑by‑feature description with common use cases, see `docs/LLM_FEATURE_SPECS.md`.
- The root `README.md` gives a high‑level description of LlumDocs and typical workflows across translation, documents, images, and email.
