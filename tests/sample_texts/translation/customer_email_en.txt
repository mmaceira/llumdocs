Hello team,

Our logistics partner in Tarragona needs the onboarding checklist translated
for their Catalan-speaking supervisors. The document explains how to calibrate
barcode scanners, register spare batteries, and submit weekly temperature logs.
Please provide a clean Catalan version that we can share during Friday's
training call.

Thanks,
Marta
