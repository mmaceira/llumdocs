The municipal innovation team is preparing a pilot for a modular battery system
that can be stacked near construction sites. Each cabinet combines lithium iron
phosphate cells with a solid-state inverter that can backfeed energy to the
distribution grid. The brief emphasizes that sensors stream telemetry every
thirty seconds to a central dispatch console so operators can reroute power
during heat waves or outages. Engineers must explain how the firmware enforces
thermal limits and how the controllers coordinate with the regional utility's
SCADA interface without exposing private network segments.
