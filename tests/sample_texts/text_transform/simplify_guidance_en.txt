The regional emergency manual instructs field coordinators to activate the
logistics bridge only after the incident commander signs the resource request
form. It also states that mutual aid teams must maintain redundant satellite
links and cross-check temperature-sensitive cargo every ninety minutes while
traveling through the desert corridor. Failure to document these steps can lead
to reimbursement disputes during the post-event audit.
